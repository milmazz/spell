# Peter Norvig's Spell Checker

Peter Norvig wrote an excellent essay on
[How to Write a Spelling Corrector][essay], where he implements a spelling
checker in a very concise way using Python, in that essay you will see a lot of
Python's list comprehensions.

I basically wondered how many lines would take and how readable would be to
write something similar in Elixir.
